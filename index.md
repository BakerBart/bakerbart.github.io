# Airbnb Clone App (Ruby on Rails)

Welcome to my developer portfolio. I'm currently working on a full-stack project that replicates key functionalities of **Airbnb** using **Ruby on Rails 7**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Hotwire (Turbo & Stimulus)**, and **PostgreSQL**.

> ⚠️ This project is in active development. Please check back soon to see progress :)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails 7
- **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, Turbo, Stimulus (Hotwire)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Payments**: Stripe integration
- **Others**: Map-based search (likely with Mapbox or Google Maps), Devise or similar authentication

---

## 🚀 Planned Features

-  User authentication (Guests & Hosts)
-  Listing management (CRUD for hosts)
-  Map-based listing search with filters
-  Booking system with availability validation
-  Stripe payment integration for secure transactions
-  User dashboards for booking management

---

## 💡 Why this project?

This application showcases my ability to:
- Build a full-featured Rails app from scratch
- Integrate third-party services (Stripe, map APIs)
- Write clean, maintainable code following MVC patterns
- Use modern UI tools (Tailwind CSS, Hotwire) to create interactive and responsive experiences

The project is based on a public YouTube tutorial by **Indigo Tech Tutorials**,

## 🛠️ In Progress

I'm currently building out features one-by-one while documenting and improving the code. I plan to:
- Deploy the finished project to a live server
- Add automated tests (RSpec + Capybara)

---

## 📌 Status

**Started:** June 2025  
**Current phase:** Backend models, authentication, and listing forms  
**Next:** Booking logic and map search

## ✅ What to add later

Here are a few things I plan to include once the app is complete:

- Screenshots & screen recordings of key features
- A video walkthrough/demo (hosted on YouTube or Loom)
- Link to the live app (e.g., on Render, Fly.io, or Heroku)
