# 📰 Python Article Parser (AI + LLMs)

This project showcases my Python skills and experience with AI and LLM prompt engineering. It takes a plain-text article and converts it into a structured HTML page using the OpenAI API.

---

## 💡 Why I Built It

I wanted to explore how LLMs can help automate content formatting. The idea was to create a tool that:
- Accepts raw text input.
- Uses GPT-4 to format it into clean, semantic HTML.
- Adds helpful image placeholders and structure.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- Prompt engineering
- HTML

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load plain text file.
2. Send it to GPT-4 with a custom prompt.
3. Parse and save HTML output with added structure.

## 📷 Sample Output

_or_ embed the actual rendered HTML in an iframe or link to GitHub sample.
